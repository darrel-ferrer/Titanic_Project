# Titanic_Project
Titanic Project Done in Software Methods Class

For this project I have two main notebooks. The first notebook is dedicated to exploratory data analysis and uses pandas_profiling to explore the data. The second notebook is my machine learning implementation, where I try a couple different models with different parameters. The models I used were random forest and gaussian naive bayes both resulting in 76.4% and 81.27% accuracy respectively.
